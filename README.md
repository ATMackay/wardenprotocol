# Warden Protocol

The Warden Protocol is a blockchain built with the Cosmos SDK to provide
various execution layers for interoperability and key management actions. It
provides functions to create spaces and keychains in the [identity
module](./blockchain/x/identity/README.md), request keys and signatures from a
specific keychain in the [keychain module](./blockchain/x/keychain/README.md), and
allows publishing custom intents that can be added through the [intent
module](./blockchain/x/intent/README.md). An intent is a set of declarative
constraints which allow a user to predefine and enforce certain rules and
activity. 

CosmWasm and Ethermint have both been integrated in order to leverage execution
of WASM and EVM-based smart contracts. Furthermore, Warden Protocol comes with the
latest IBC version to connect with other chains via IBC to transfer of funds or
interchain accounts and queries.

## Joining the Network

We have provided documentation on setting up and using Warden.
